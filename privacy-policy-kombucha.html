  <title>Privacy Policy - KombuchaMap</title>

<body>
  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p><strong>KombuchaMap</strong> (hereinafter "the Application") is published by Szymolivtech, the data controller. We are committed to protecting the privacy of our users and complying with the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and other applicable privacy laws. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use, store, and secure it, and what rights users have. For any questions, contact us via the email address at the end of this document.</p>

  <h2>Data Collected</h2>
  <p>We limit data collection strictly to what is necessary for the Application to function. Specifically, the following data may be present in our system:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Anonymous Identifier (UUID):</strong> A locally generated identifier used only for moderation purposes.</li>
    <li><strong>Map Markers:</strong> Each marker added by a user includes a position on the map (internal coordinates, not real GPS), a title, a comment, an optional image, and a date in DD/MM/YYYY format.</li>
    <li><strong>Abuse Reports:</strong> When a marker is reported, we collect the marker ID, the reason for the report, and the anonymous ID of the user who reported it.</li>
    <li><strong>Location Data (approximate):</strong> While the Application itself does not access your GPS location, some integrated third-party SDKs provided by Google (such as Google Analytics, Google Ads, and the User Messaging Platform) may collect approximate location data (e.g., based on IP address) for purposes such as analytics and advertising. We do not access or store this data ourselves.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not collect any other personal data. In particular, we do not store your GPS location, name, email, phone number, or any identifying information. The Application does not read your device’s Android ID.</p>

  <h2>Use of Data</h2>
  <p>The collected data is used solely to ensure the proper functioning of KombuchaMap and content moderation. Specifically:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Manage markers: display, save, and update user-added markers on the map.</li>
    <li>Moderation: handle abuse reports and, if necessary, remove markers or block abusive users (identified by their anonymous ID).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not use data for commercial, advertising, or analytical purposes. We do not share or sell your data, and no targeted advertising or profiling is conducted.</p>
  <p>Some third-party SDKs integrated into the Application (such as Google Analytics, Ads, and UMP) may collect and process limited data (such as approximate location) for analytics or advertising purposes. This data is handled directly by Google and is subject to their respective privacy policies. We do not have direct access to or control over this information.</p>

  <h2>Content Moderation</h2>
  <p>User-submitted content (text, images, etc.) is not the responsibility of KombuchaMap. However, we reserve the right to remove inappropriate content or block abusive users. Anonymous IDs associated with abusive behavior may be blacklisted.</p>

  <h2>Data Storage</h2>
  <p>Data (markers, reports, and anonymous IDs) is stored in Firebase Realtime Database (by Google Inc.). Firebase servers are secure and access is restricted to authorized KombuchaMap developers. Data is transmitted via secure SSL/TLS connections and hosted on infrastructure compliant with international privacy standards. Only explicitly listed data is stored.</p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>We implement strict technical and organizational measures to protect your data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Encrypted communication: all exchanges with Firebase use SSL/TLS encryption.</li>
    <li>Restricted access: only authorized team members can access the Firebase console.</li>
    <li>Backups and integrity: data is regularly backed up on secure Firebase servers.</li>
    <li>Pseudonymization: we use anonymous IDs (UUIDs) instead of personal data to limit identification risks.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Markers: kept as long as the user does not delete them and they remain useful.</li>
    <li>Reports: retained as long as needed for moderation.</li>
    <li>Anonymous IDs: retained to consistently identify anonymous users for abuse control.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Upon request, we will delete any personal data you identify, within one month. Only anonymized, non-identifiable data may remain for internal statistics.</p>

  <h2>User Rights</h2>
  <p>According to the GDPR and CCPA, you have the following rights:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Right of access</li>
    <li>Right to rectification</li>
    <li>Right to erasure (right to be forgotten)</li>
    <li>Right to restrict processing</li>
    <li>Right to object</li>
    <li>Right to data portability</li>
    <li>Right to withdraw consent (not applicable here as no consent is required)</li>
    <li>Right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority (e.g., CNIL in France)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you wish to modify or withdraw your advertising consent (e.g., regarding personalized ads), you can do so at any time directly from the app. A consent management form will be displayed again, allowing you to make your choice in accordance with GDPR and other applicable regulations.</p>
  <p>To exercise your rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:szymolivtech@gmail.com">szymolivtech@gmail.com</a>. We respond within the legally mandated timeframes.</p>
  <p>For California residents: you may request a list of collected data categories and their deletion. We do not sell your data, so certain CCPA provisions do not apply. We will not penalize you for exercising your rights.</p>

  <h2>Policy Updates</h2>
  <p>This privacy policy may be updated to reflect changes to the application or regulations. Any new version will be posted in the app with an updated date. Major changes (e.g., new features involving data) will be clearly announced. We encourage you to check this page regularly.</p>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> June 1, 2025</p>
